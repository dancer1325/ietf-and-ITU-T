* WebSocket Protocol
  * üí°enables 2-way communication between client <- & -> remote host üí°
    * client / runs untrusted code | controlled environment
    * remote host / accept communications -- from -- client's code 
  * 's security model == origin-based security model / used | web browsers
  * == opening handshake + basic message framing / layered | TCP
  * 's goal
    * == mechanism for browser-based applications / 
      * need 2-way communication <- with -> servers
      * NOT rely on opening MULTIPLE HTTP connections (_Example:_ XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s & long polling)

# Introduction
* | create web applications / need client <- can communicate with -> server
  * _Example:_ instant messaging & gaming applications
  * HISTORICAL requirements
    * ‚ö†Ô∏èabuse of HTTP ‚ö†Ô∏è
      * Reason: üß† poll the server -- , via DISTINCT HTTP calls,for -- updates üß†
      * cons
        * server -- is forced to use -- DIFFERENT underlying TCP connections / EACH client
          * _Example:_
            * | send information -- to the -- client
            * NEW one / EACH incoming message
        * wire protocol -- has a -- HIGH overhead / 
          * HTTP header / EACH client-to-server message
        * client-side script -- forced to maintain a -- mapping / outgoing connections -- to the -- incoming connection
          * Reason: üß† track replies üß†
      * solution
        * üí°1! TCP connection / traffic | BOTH directionsüí°
  * WebSocket Protocol
    * üí°solution | PREVIOUS problem üí°
    * \+ WebSocket API [WSAPI] == ALTERNATIVE to HTTP polling / 2-way communication web page -- & -- remote server
* TODO: The same technique can be used for a variety of web applications:
  games, stock tickers, multiuser applications with simultaneous
  editing, user interfaces exposing server-side services in real time,
  etc.
