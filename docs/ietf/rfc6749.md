* OAuth 2.0 authorization framework
  * 💡enables a third-party application -- to obtain -- limited access | HTTP service / on behalf of a resource owner 💡
  * 's MAIN ideas
    * 👀ADD authorization layer (== server) 👀    
      * issues access token
        * == set of credentials / != resource owner's issued
        * == string / specify scope + lifetime + OTHER access attributes
        * -- used by -- third-party clients
        * -- approved by -- the resource owner   
    * client's role != resource owner's role
  * ⚠️OTHER protocols / != HTTP -> out of scope here ⚠️
  * ❌-- NOT backward compatible with -- OAuth 1.0 ❌
    * BOTH versions could co-exist | network
    * recommendations
      * NEW implementations -- support -- OAuth 2.0
      * OAuth 1.0 -- used -- | EXISTING deployments 

* traditional client-server authentication model
  * client requests -- by authenticating with the server, via resource owner's credentials, an -- access-restricted resource | server
    * == resource owner -- shares its credentials, with -- third party
  * ⚠️risk ⚠️
    * Third-party applications -- are required to -- store the resource owner's credentials
      * Reason: 🧠for future use🧠
    * Servers -- are required to support -- password authentication
      * Note: 🧠 password authentication == security weaknesses 🧠
    * Third-party applications -- gain -- broad access | resource owner's protected resources /
      * resource owners can NOT restrict
        * duration or
        * access | LIMITED subset of resources
    * Resource owners can NOT revoke access | individual third party WITHOUT revoking access | ALL third parties
      * -- is done, by changing the -- third party's password
    * if ANY third-party application results in compromise -> end-user's password & ALL data are compromised

# Protocol Endpoints
* == 2 authorization server endpoints + 1 
  * authorization server endpoints
    * Authorization endpoint
      * client calls it -- to obtain, via user-agent redirection, -- authorization from the resource owner 
    * Token endpoint
      * client calls it -- to exchange an authorization grant for an access token, typically with client authentication.
  * client endpoint
    * Redirection endpoint
      * authorization server -- returns, via resource owner user-agent, responses / has authorization credentials, to the -- client   
  * NOT used BOTH -- by -- EVERY authorization grant type
  * extension grant types -- MAY define -- additional endpoints
